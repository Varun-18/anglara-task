# Anglara Task

Welcome to the Anglara Task project! This is a Node.js application built with Express and TypeScript. This README will guide you through setting up and running the project, as well as provide examples of API responses.

## Deployment
The project has been successfully deployed on Render. Please note that the deployment is done on a free instance, which means the initial request can take up to 50 seconds for the instance to boot up and start running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (optional, for development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Varun-18/anglara-task.git
   cd anglara-task
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

After building, you can start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Scripts

Here are the available scripts you can use:

- `dev`: Starts the server in development mode using `nodemon`.
- `build`: Cleans the `dist` directory, compiles TypeScript files, and copies view files to the `dist` directory.
- `copyfiles`: Copies view files from `src/views` to `dist`.
- `lint`: Formats the code using Prettier and checks for linting issues with ESLint.
- `start`: Starts the server from the compiled JavaScript in the `dist` directory.
- `test`: Runs the test suite using Jest.
